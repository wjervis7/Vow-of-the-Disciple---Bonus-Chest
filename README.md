# Vow of the Disciple - Bonus Chest

After the payload escort section, as you enter the pyramid, there is a totem, with 3 symbols, on it.

You need to find the rooms, with these symbols, and activate the symbols, to get a bonus drop, after beating Rhulk. **ONLY** those symbols should be activated; any extras will prevent the bonus drop from dropping.

If done correctly, a message pops up, in the game feed (bottom left, above super bar), stating _The Disciple recognizes your offering..._

After beating the boss, the chest will drop an extra engram, which is guaranteed, to be a Deepsight Raid Weapon (red border).

This bonus drop, is once **PER WEEK**, **PER ACCOUNT**.

The symbols only count, if they are activated.  You can activate the wrong symbol, as long as you deactivate it, by shooting it, again.

The raid must be completed, in a single sitting, similar to Divinity.

You can view the symbols, and where to find them, [here][rooms].

You can use this [helper], to select the symbols, and see where the rooms are, while you are in a Vow of the Disciple run.
